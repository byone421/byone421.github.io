> the little prince discovers a garden of roses


&emsp;&emsp;But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men.

&emsp;&emsp;"Good morning," he said.

&emsp;&emsp;He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses.

&emsp;&emsp;"Good morning," said the roses.

&emsp;&emsp;The little prince gazed at them. They all looked like his flower.

&emsp;&emsp;"Who are you?" he demanded, thunderstruck.

&emsp;&emsp;"We are roses," the roses said.

&emsp;&emsp;And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!

&emsp;&emsp;"She would be very much annoyed," he said to himself, "if she should see that… she would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life-- for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die…"

&emsp;&emsp;Then he went on with his reflections: "I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees-- and one of them perhaps extinct forever… that doesn't make me a very great prince…"

&emsp;&emsp;And he lay down in the grass and cried.

>  小王子发现了一座玫瑰花园


&emsp;&emsp;后来，在沙地、岩石和积雪中走了很久之后，小王子终于发现了一条路。而所有的路，都会通往人类的住处。

&emsp;&emsp;“你们好，”他说。

&emsp;&emsp;他正站在一个花园前，园子里玫瑰花盛开。

&emsp;&emsp;“你好，”玫瑰花们说。

&emsp;&emsp;小王子凝视着她们。她们每一朵看起来都像他的那朵花。

&emsp;&emsp;“你们是谁？”他惊愕地问道。

&emsp;&emsp;“我们是玫瑰，”玫瑰花们回答。

&emsp;&emsp;小王子陷入了巨大的悲伤之中。他的那朵花曾告诉他，她是全宇宙中绝无仅有的一朵。可现在，单单这一个花园里，就有五千朵和她一模一样的花！

&emsp;&emsp;“如果她看到这些，一定会非常恼火的，”他心想，“她会咳得惊天动地，还会假装死去，好逃避别人的嘲笑。而我，也不得不假装去护理她，让她活过来——因为如果我不这么做，如果我不也跟着放下身段去配合她，她可能真的会为了让我羞愧而死掉……”

&emsp;&emsp;接着，他又继续沉思道：“我原以为自己很富有，拥有一朵全世界独一无二的花；可原来我拥有的不过是一朵平凡的玫瑰。一朵平凡的玫瑰，加上三座高及膝盖的火山——其中一座还可能永远熄灭了……这些并不能让我成为一个多么伟大的王子……”

&emsp;&emsp;于是，他趴在草丛里，哭了起来。
