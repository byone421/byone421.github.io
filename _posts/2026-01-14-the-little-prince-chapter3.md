> the narrator learns more about from where the little prince came

&emsp;&emsp;It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.

&emsp;&emsp;The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:

&emsp;&emsp;"What is that object?"

&emsp;&emsp;"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."

&emsp;&emsp;And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.

&emsp;&emsp;He cried out, then:

&emsp;&emsp;"What! You dropped down from the sky?"

&emsp;&emsp;"Yes," I answered, modestly.

&emsp;&emsp;"Oh! That is funny!"

&emsp;&emsp;And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.

&emsp;&emsp;Then he added:

&emsp;&emsp;"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"

&emsp;&emsp;At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly:

&emsp;&emsp;"Do you come from another planet?"

&emsp;&emsp;But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:

&emsp;&emsp;"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away…"

&emsp;&emsp;And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.

&emsp;&emsp;You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.

&emsp;&emsp;"My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live,' of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?"

&emsp;&emsp;After a reflective silence he answered:

&emsp;&emsp;"The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house."

&emsp;&emsp;"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."

&emsp;&emsp;But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:

&emsp;&emsp;"Tie him! What a queer idea!"

&emsp;&emsp;"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."

&emsp;&emsp;My friend broke into another peal of laughter:

&emsp;&emsp;"But where do you think he would go?"

&emsp;&emsp;"Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."

&emsp;&emsp;Then the little prince said, earnestly:

&emsp;&emsp;"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"

&emsp;&emsp;And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:

&emsp;&emsp;"Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far…"

>  叙述者逐渐了解到小王子是从哪里来的
>

&emsp;&emsp;我费了好长时间才弄清楚他是从哪里来的。小王子向我提出了很多问题，可 是，对我提出的问题，他好象压根没有听见似的。他无意中吐露的一些话逐渐使我搞清了他的来历。

&emsp;&emsp;当他第一次瞅见我的飞机时（我就不画出我的飞机了，因为这种图画对我来说太复杂了），他问我道：

&emsp;&emsp;“那是什么东西？”

&emsp;&emsp;“那不是一件东西。它会飞。那是一架飞机。那是我的飞机。”

&emsp;&emsp;我为他知道我会飞而感到有些得意。

&emsp;&emsp;他随即叫了起来：

&emsp;&emsp;“什么！你是从天上掉下来的？”

&emsp;&emsp;“是的。”我谦虚地回答。

&emsp;&emsp; “哦！这可真有意思！”

&emsp;&emsp;小王子随即发出了一阵清脆动人的笑声，这让我很不高兴——我不喜欢别人把我的不幸当成笑话。

&emsp;&emsp;接着他又说：

&emsp;&emsp;“那你也是从天上来的喽！你的星球是哪一颗？”

&emsp;&emsp;就在那一刻，我仿佛在他那难以捉摸的存在之谜中捕捉到了一线光亮，便突然追问道：

&emsp;&emsp;“你是从另一颗星球来的吗？”

&emsp;&emsp;可他没有回答。他一面看着我的飞机，一面微微地点点头，接着说道：

&emsp;&emsp;“的确，用那种东西，你不可能是从很远的地方来的……”

&emsp;&emsp;说完，他陷入了长久的沉思。随后，他从口袋里掏出我的那只羊，完全沉浸在对自己宝贝的凝视之中。

&emsp;&emsp;你可以想象，那句关于“其他星球”的半吐半露，是多么激起了我的好奇心。 因此，我费了很大的劲，想要在这个问题上多探听出一些情况。

&emsp;&emsp;“小家伙，你是从哪里来的？你所说的‘我住的地方’究竟是什么？你想把你的羊带到哪里去？”

&emsp;&emsp;他沉默地想了一会儿，然后回答说：

&emsp;&emsp;“好在有你给我的那只箱子，夜晚可以给小羊当房子用。”

&emsp;&emsp;“那当然，如果你听话的话，我还可以再给你一根绳子，好让你白天把他拴起来，再给你一根桩子，把他系在上面。”

&emsp;&emsp;小王子似乎被这个提议吓了一跳：

&emsp;&emsp;“拴起来！这主意可真奇怪！”

&emsp;&emsp;“如果你不栓住它，它就到处跑，那么它会跑丢的。”

&emsp;&emsp;我的朋友又一次放声笑了起来：

&emsp;&emsp;“那你觉得他会跑到哪里去呢？”

&emsp;&emsp;“不管什么地方。它一直往前跑……”

&emsp;&emsp;小王子认真地说道：

&emsp;&emsp;“那没关系。我住的地方，一切都很小！”

&emsp;&emsp;接着，他略带伤感地又补充了一句：

&emsp;&emsp;“一直朝前走，也不会走出多远……”
