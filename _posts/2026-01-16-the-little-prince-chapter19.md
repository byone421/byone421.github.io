> the little prince climbs a mountain range


&emsp;&emsp;After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain. The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees. And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool. "From a mountain as high as this one," he said to himself, "I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance, and all the people…"

&emsp;&emsp;But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles.

&emsp;&emsp;"Good morning," he said courteously.

&emsp;&emsp;"Good morning--Good morning--Good morning," answered the echo.

&emsp;&emsp;"Who are you?" said the little prince.

&emsp;&emsp;"Who are you--Who are you--Who are you?" answered the echo.

&emsp;&emsp;"Be my friends. I am all alone," he said.

&emsp;&emsp;然而，他什么也没看见，除了像针尖一样锐利的岩石山峰。

&emsp;&emsp;“你好，”他彬彬有礼地说道。

&emsp;&emsp;“你好……你好……你好……”回声回答道。

&emsp;&emsp;“你是谁？”小王子问。

&emsp;&emsp;“你是谁……你是谁……你是谁？”回声回答道。

&emsp;&emsp;“跟我做朋友吧，我孤零零的一个人，”他说。

&emsp;&emsp;“我孤零零的一个人……孤零零的一个人……孤零零的一个人，”回声回答道。

&emsp;&emsp;“真是颗古怪的星球！”他想，“这儿到处是干旱，到处是尖角，到处是严酷和荒凉。而且这儿的人一点想象力都没有。你对他们说什么，他们就重复什么……在我的星球上，我有一朵花；她总是第一个开口说话的……”
