> the little prince encounters a merchant

&emsp;&emsp;"Good morning," said the little prince.

&emsp;&emsp;"Good morning," said the merchant.

&emsp;&emsp;This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.

&emsp;&emsp;"Why are you selling those?" asked the little prince.

&emsp;&emsp;"Because they save a tremendous amount of time," said the merchant. "Computations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week."

&emsp;&emsp;"And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?"

&emsp;&emsp;"Anything you like…"

&emsp;&emsp;"As for me," said the little prince to himself, "if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water."

> 小王子遇到了一个商人

&emsp;&emsp;“你好，”小王子说。

&emsp;&emsp;“你好，”商人说。

&emsp;&emsp;这是一个贩卖止渴药片的商人。这种药片是专门发明用来止渴的。你每周只需要吞下一片，就再也不需要喝水了。

&emsp;&emsp;“你为什么要卖这种东西？”小王子问。

&emsp;&emsp;“因为这能节省大量的时间，”商人说，“专家们已经计算过了。有了这些药片，你每周可以节省五十三分钟。”

&emsp;&emsp;“那我要拿这五十三分钟做什么呢？”

&emsp;&emsp;“随你喜欢……”

&emsp;&emsp;“至于我，”小王子自言自语道，“如果我有五十三分钟可以随意支配，我会悠哉游哉地向一潭清泉走去。”
