> the narrator and the little prince, thirsty, hunt for a well in the desert


&emsp;&emsp;It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.

&emsp;&emsp;"Ah," I said to the little prince, "these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!"

&emsp;&emsp;"My friend the fox--" the little prince said to me.

&emsp;&emsp;"My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!"

&emsp;&emsp;"Why not?"

&emsp;&emsp;"Because I am about to die of thirst…"

&emsp;&emsp;He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:

&emsp;&emsp;"It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend…"

&emsp;&emsp;"He has no way of guessing the danger," I said to myself. "He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs…"

&emsp;&emsp;But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:

&emsp;&emsp;"I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well…"

&emsp;&emsp;I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking.

&emsp;&emsp;When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince's last words came reeling back into my memory:

&emsp;&emsp;"Then you are thirsty, too?" I demanded.

&emsp;&emsp;But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:

&emsp;&emsp;"Water may also be good for the heart…"

&emsp;&emsp;I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.

&emsp;&emsp;He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:

&emsp;&emsp;"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."

&emsp;&emsp;I replied, "Yes, that is so." And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.

&emsp;&emsp;"The desert is beautiful," the little prince added.

&emsp;&emsp;And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams…

&emsp;&emsp;"What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well…"

![](/img/in-post/little-prince/chapter24_1.png)

&emsp;&emsp;I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart…

&emsp;&emsp;"Yes," I said to the little prince. "The house, the stars, the desert-- what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!"

&emsp;&emsp;"I am glad," he said, "that you agree with my fox."

&emsp;&emsp;As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible…"

&emsp;&emsp;As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower-- the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep…" And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind…

&emsp;&emsp;And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.

> 叙述者和小王子口渴了，他们在沙漠中寻找一口水井  


&emsp;&emsp;我在沙漠中出事已经第八天了。当我听完那个商人的故事时，正喝下我最后的一滴水。

&emsp;&emsp;“啊，”我对小王子说，“你这些回忆确实很迷人，但我还没修好我的飞机，我已经没水喝了。如果我也能悠哉游哉地向一潭清泉走去，我也会感到非常幸福的！”

&emsp;&emsp;“我的狐狸朋友……”小王子对我说。

&emsp;&emsp;“我的小家伙，现在这事儿已经跟狐狸没关系了！”

&emsp;&emsp;“为什么没关系？”

&emsp;&emsp;“因为我快要渴死了……”

&emsp;&emsp;他并不理解我的逻辑，他回答我：

&emsp;&emsp;“即便快要死了，有过一个朋友也是件好事。 比如我，就很开心曾有过一只狐狸当朋友……”

&emsp;&emsp;“他根本无法预料到危险，”我心想，“他从不知道什么是饥饿，什么是干渴。他只要有一点阳光就够了……”

&emsp;&emsp;但他静静地看着我，仿佛看穿了我的心思，回答道：

&emsp;&emsp;“我也渴了。我们去找口水井吧……”

&emsp;&emsp;我做了一个疲惫的手势。在茫茫无际的沙漠中漫无目的地寻找一口水井，这简直是荒唐。然而，我们还是起程了。

&emsp;&emsp;当我们沉默地跋涉了几个小时后，夜幕降临，繁星开始闪现。干渴让我有些发烧，我看着那些星星，仿佛身处梦境。小王子最后说的那些话，在我记忆中摇晃着浮现出来：

&emsp;&emsp;“那么，你也渴了吗？”我追问道。

&emsp;&emsp;但他没有回答我的问题。他只是对我说：

&emsp;&emsp;“水，对心也是有好处的……”

&emsp;&emsp;我不明白这个回答，但我什么也没说。我很清楚，你是没办法对他打破砂锅问到底的。

&emsp;&emsp;他累了，坐了下来。我也在他身边坐下。沉默了一会儿，他又开口说话了：

&emsp;&emsp;“星星是美丽的，因为那里有一朵看不见的花。”

&emsp;&emsp;我回答说：“是的，确实如此。”我没有再多说什么，只是望着月光下延展开去的层层沙脊。

&emsp;&emsp;“沙漠也是美丽的，”小王子补充道。

&emsp;&emsp;确实如此。我一直很喜欢沙漠。人坐在沙漠的沙丘上，什么也看不见，什么也听不到。然而，在寂静中，却有什么东西在跳动着，闪耀着……

&emsp;&emsp;“沙漠之所以美丽，”小王子说，“是因为在某个角落，藏着一口井……”

![](/img/in-post/little-prince/chapter24_1.png)


&emsp;&emsp;我突然理解了沙砾中那股神秘的光芒的含义，这让我感到十分惊讶。。当我还是个小男孩时，我住在一座老房子里。传说那里埋藏着一份宝藏。当然，从来没有人知道该如何找到它，甚至可能根本没人去找过。但它为那座房子笼罩了一层迷人的魔力。我的家，在它的心灵深处，隐藏着一个秘密……

&emsp;&emsp;“是的，”我对小王子说，“无论是房子、星星，还是沙漠——赋予它们美丽的东西，是看不见的！”

&emsp;&emsp;“我很高兴，”他说，“你和我的狐狸想到一块儿去了。”

&emsp;&emsp;当小王子沉睡时，我把他抱在怀里，重新出发了。我感到心潮澎湃，激动不已。我觉得自己正抱着一件极其脆弱的宝贝。在我看来，甚至全世界都没有比这更脆弱的东西了。在月光下，我看着他苍白的额头、紧闭的双眼，还有那在风中颤动的发丝，我对自己说：“我所看到的只是一个躯壳。最重要的东西，是看不见的……”

&emsp;&emsp;当他的双唇微启，带着一抹若有若无的微笑时，我再次对自己说：“这个沉睡的小王子最让我深切感动的，是他对一朵花的忠诚——那朵玫瑰的形象，像一盏灯的火焰，即便在他熟睡时，也穿透他的整个生命散发着光芒……”我感到他更加脆弱了。我觉得有必要保护他，就像保护一盏会被微风吹灭的火苗……

&emsp;&emsp;就这样走着，黎明时分，我发现了那口井。
