>  the little prince goes looking for men and meets a flower

&emsp;&emsp;The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower. It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all.

&emsp;&emsp;"Good morning," said the little prince.

&emsp;&emsp;"Good morning," said the flower.

&emsp;&emsp;"Where are the men?" the little prince asked, politely.

&emsp;&emsp;The flower had once seen a caravan passing.

&emsp;&emsp;"Men?" she echoed. "I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult."

&emsp;&emsp;"Goodbye," said the little prince.

&emsp;&emsp;"Goodbye," said the flower.

> 小王子在寻找人类的过程中遇到了一朵花



![](/img/in-post/little-prince/chapter18_1.png)

&emsp;&emsp;小王子穿越了沙漠，只遇到了一朵花。一朵只有三片花瓣的花，一朵微不足道的小花……

&emsp;&emsp;“你好，”小王子说。

&emsp;&emsp;“你好，”花儿说。

&emsp;&emsp;“人们都在哪儿呢？”小王子客气地问。

&emsp;&emsp;这朵花曾经看见过一支骆驼商队经过。

&emsp;&emsp;“人们吗？我想，大约有六七个人吧。几年前我见过他们。但我不知道去哪儿才能找到他们。风把他们吹跑了。他们没有根，这让他们生活得很辛苦。”

&emsp;&emsp;“再见，”小王子说。

&emsp;&emsp;“再见，”花儿说。
