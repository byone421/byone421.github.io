> the little prince visits the conceited man


&emsp;&emsp;The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man.

&emsp;&emsp;"Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!" he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming.

&emsp;&emsp;For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.

&emsp;&emsp;"Good morning," said the little prince. "That is a queer hat you are wearing."

&emsp;&emsp;"It is a hat for salutes," the conceited man replied. "It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way."

&emsp;&emsp;"Yes?" said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.

&emsp;&emsp;"Clap your hands, one against the other," the conceited man now directed him.

&emsp;&emsp;The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.

&emsp;&emsp;"This is more entertaining than the visit to the king," the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man against raised his hat in salute.

&emsp;&emsp;After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game's monotony.

&emsp;&emsp;"And what should one do to make the hat come down?" he asked.

&emsp;&emsp;But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise.

&emsp;&emsp;"Do you really admire me very much?" he demanded of the little prince.

&emsp;&emsp;"What does that mean-- 'admire'?"

&emsp;&emsp;"To admire mean that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet."

&emsp;&emsp;"But you are the only man on your planet!"

&emsp;&emsp;"Do me this kindness. Admire me just the same."

&emsp;&emsp;"I admire you," said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, "but what is there in that to interest you so much?"

&emsp;&emsp;And the little prince went away.

&emsp;&emsp;"The grown-ups are certainly very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.

> 小王子拜访了一个爱虚荣的人
>

&emsp;&emsp;第二颗星球上住着一个爱虚荣的人。

&emsp;&emsp;“啊！啊！我的一位崇拜者要来拜访我了！”他还没等小王子走近，老远就大声叫喊起来。

![](/img/in-post/little-prince/chapter11_1.png)

&emsp;&emsp;因为在爱虚荣的人眼里，别人全都是他们的崇拜者。

&emsp;&emsp;“你好，”小王子说，“你戴的那顶帽子真古怪。”

&emsp;&emsp;“这是为了向人致意用的。”爱虚荣的人回答道，“当人们向我欢呼的时候， 我就用帽子向他们致意。可惜，没有一个人经过这里。”

&emsp;&emsp;“是吗？”小王子说，他没听懂对方在说什么。

&emsp;&emsp;“把你的两只手拍在一起，”爱虚荣的人指示道。

&emsp;&emsp;小王子拍起手来。爱虚荣的人谦逊地举起帽子致意。

&emsp;&emsp;“这比访问国王那儿有趣多了，”小王子心想。于是他又拍起手来。爱虚荣的人也再次举起帽子致意。

&emsp;&emsp;这种练习进行了五分钟后，小王子对这种单调的游戏感到厌倦了。

&emsp;&emsp;“那要怎么做才能让帽子掉下来呢？”他问。

&emsp;&emsp;但爱虚荣的人根本听不见。虚荣的人只听得进赞美的话。

&emsp;&emsp;“你真的非常崇拜我吗？”他盘问小王子。

&emsp;&emsp;“‘崇拜’是什么意思？”

&emsp;&emsp;“崇拜意味着，你承认我是这颗星球上最英俊、着装最考究、最富有、也最聪明的人。”

&emsp;&emsp;“可这颗星球上只有你一个人呀！”

&emsp;&emsp;“就当是帮我个忙，还是崇拜我吧。”

&emsp;&emsp;“我崇拜你，”小王子轻轻耸了耸肩说道，“但这有什么好让你如此感兴趣的呢？”

&emsp;&emsp;于是小王子离开了。

&emsp;&emsp;“大人们确实非常古怪，”他在旅途中自言自语道。
