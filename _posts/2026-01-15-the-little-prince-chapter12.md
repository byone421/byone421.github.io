> the little prince visits the tippler


&emsp;&emsp;The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.

&emsp;&emsp;"What are you doing there?" he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.

&emsp;&emsp;"I am drinking," replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.

&emsp;&emsp;"Why are you drinking?" demanded the little prince.

&emsp;&emsp;"So that I may forget," replied the tippler.

&emsp;&emsp;"Forget what?" inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.

&emsp;&emsp;"Forget that I am ashamed," the tippler confessed, hanging his head.

&emsp;&emsp;"Ashamed of what?" insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.

&emsp;&emsp;"Ashamed of drinking!" The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.

&emsp;&emsp;And the little prince went away, puzzled.

&emsp;&emsp;"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.

&emsp;&emsp;“你在那儿干什么呢？”小王子问那个酒鬼。他发现酒鬼正沉默地坐在一堆空瓶子和一堆满瓶子面前。

&emsp;&emsp;“我在喝酒，”酒鬼神情忧郁地回答道。

&emsp;&emsp;“你为什么要喝酒呢？”小王子追问道。

&emsp;&emsp;“为了忘却，”酒鬼回答。

&emsp;&emsp;“忘却什么？”小王子询问道，他已经开始同情起他来了。

&emsp;&emsp;“忘却我的羞愧，”酒鬼垂下头坦白道。

&emsp;&emsp;“羞愧什么呢？”小王子想帮助他，于是进一步追问。

&emsp;&emsp;“羞愧我喝酒！”酒鬼结束了谈话，彻底陷入了那不可动摇的沉默之中。

&emsp;&emsp;小王子离开了，满心困惑。

&emsp;&emsp;“大人们确实非常、非常古怪，”他在旅途中自言自语道。
